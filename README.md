# color_prediction
## Overview
The Color Prediction project aims to utilize a webcam to capture real-time video feeds and predict the color of objects in the video frame. This project leverages computer vision techniques and machine learning algorithms to identify and predict the color of objects detected by the webcam.
## Features
- Real-Time Video Capture: The application captures video from the webcam in real-time.
- Color Detection: It processes each frame of the video to detect the dominant color of objects within the frame.
- Color Prediction: The detected colors are analyzed and predicted using a pre-trained machine learning model.
- User Interface: A user-friendly interface to display the video feed and the predicted color.
## Technologies Used
- Python: The main programming language used for the project.
- OpenCV: An open-source computer vision library used for video capture and processing.
- Numpy: A library for numerical operations.
- Machine Learning Model: A pre-trained model for color prediction.
